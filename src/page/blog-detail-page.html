          A CLUNKY AND WEAK “LAST DANCE” SUPERHERO JAUNT
        </h1>
        <p class="py-5">
          In 2018, Sony Pictures released Venom, a superhero origin movie that
          was to focus on the classic Spider-Man villain. Directed by Reuben
          Fleischer, the film, which starred Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, and
          Riz Ahmed, follows new journalist Eddie Brock, who unwillingly gains
          superpowers after becoming the host of an alien symbiote, who calls
          himself Venom, whose species plan to invade earth. The film received
          generally negative reviews from both critics and moviegoers alike,
          with many finding criticisms the film’s messy narrative, inconsistent
          tones, and lacking a strong connection to Spider-Man universe.
          Although, many praised Tom Hardy’s performance throughout the movie as
          Brock / Venom. Still, looking beyond those points, Venom was
          considered a box office success as the feature grossed roughly $856
          million, becoming the seventh highest grossing movie of 2018. Because
          of this, Sony Pictures saw the benefit of expanding upon this
          particular character and decided to greenlight a sequel with Venom:
          Let There be Carnage being released in October 2021 Hardy reprised his
          role as Eddie Brock and starred opposite actor Woody Harrelson, who
          plays Cletus Kasady, a convicted serial killer that becomes a
          formidable foe after become the host of an offshoot of Venom named
          Carnage. Like the previous film, Venom: Let There Be Carnage faced
          mixed to negative reviews and opinions, but was deemed a box office
          success by making well over $500 million worldwide. Now, three after
          the release of Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Sony Pictures and director
          Kelly Marcel present the suppose final entry in this representation of
          Eddie Brock and his alien symbiote with the release of Venom: The Last
          Dance. Does this movie close out the narrative that began back in 2018
          in a satisfactory way or is it just a haphazard and incoherent
          superhero outing that lacks both substance and finesse within this
          undertaking?Under his now “commonplace” unusual circumstance, Eddie
          Brock (Tom Hardy) is current a fugitive, looking to hide out in Mexico
          with his symbiote partner-in-crime, Venom, after Detective Mulligan
          (Stephan Graham) is killed. When the d Carnage had their problems in
          the previous two Venom movies, Knull and his army of xenophages feel
          thinly sketched and flat as villains.

          n 2015, Pixar Animation Studios released their fifteenth animated
          feature film titled Inside Out, showcasing a “wave of emotions” within
          this now beloved cartoon motion picture. Directed by Pete Docter, the
          film, which starred the voice talents for Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith,
          Bill Hader, Lewis Black, and Mindy Kaling, follows the inner workings
          of the mind of Riley, a young girl who adapts to her recent family’s
          relocation as five personified emotions manage her thoughts and
          actions during this transition period. Debuting in theaters on June
          19th, 2015, Inside Out went onto reach critical acclaim during its
          theatrical run, with many praising the film for its craftmanship,
          screenplay, plot, subject matter, and all the vocal performances. In
          addition, the movie went on to gross over $858 million at the box
          office worldwide and finished as the seventh highest grossing film of
          2015. In conjunction with that, Inside Out went on to receive numerous
          accolades during the various award season, including winning Best
          Animated Feature for both the 88th Academy Award and the 2015’s Golden
          Globes. Furthermore, many news journalist and film institute /
          organization praised Inside Out, citing it to be one of the best
          animated films ever made. Now, almost nine years since its original
          release, Pixar Animated Studios (in association with Walt Disney
          Studios) and director Kelsey Mann present the long-awaited follow-up
          sequel to the critical 2015 film with the release of Inside Out 2.
          Does this sequel find merit and heart within its colorful cartoon
          narrative or is it a subpar and emotionless film that can’t replicate
          the same type of charm and magic that the original movie was able to
          capture?Riley (Kensington Tallman) is growing up and is now a
          teenager, turning the age of 13 and putting pressure on her emotions
          to deal with her new puberty setting in. At the ready are Riley’s core
          emotions, including Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger
          (Lewis Black), Fear, (Tony Hale), and Disgust (Liza Lapria), with the
          gang working to protect the human’s Belief system, which makes up who
          she is. Disrupting Riley’s HQ is the arrival of new emotions that
          coincide with her new teenage angst, which includes Anxiety (Maya
          Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adele Exarchopoulos), and
          Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser). Moving into Riley’s control room
          to express her new feelings, the hockey-loving teenager is now off to
          camp with her friends,
