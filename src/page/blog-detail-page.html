              In 2018, Sony Pictures released Venom, a superhero origin movie
              that was to focus on the classic Spider-Man villain. Directed by
              Reuben Fleischer, the film, which starred Tom Hardy, Michelle
              Williams, and Riz Ahmed, follows new journalist Eddie Brock, who
              unwillingly gains superpowers after becoming the host of an alien
              symbiote, who calls himself Venom, whose species plan to invade
              earth. The film received generally negative reviews from both
              critics and moviegoers alike, with many finding criticisms the
              film’s messy narrative, inconsistent tones, and lacking a strong
              connection to Spider-Man universe. Although, many praised Tom
              Hardy’s performance throughout the movie as Brock / Venom. Still,
              looking beyond those points, Venom was considered a box office
              success as the feature grossed roughly $856 million, becoming the
              seventh highest grossing movie of 2018. Because of this, Sony
              Pictures saw the benefit of expanding upon this particular
              character and decided to greenlight a sequel with Venom: Let There
              be Carnage being released in October 2021 Hardy reprised his role
              as Eddie Brock and starred opposite actor Woody Harrelson, who
              plays Cletus Kasady, a convicted serial killer that becomes a
              formidable foe after become the host of an offshoot of Venom named
              Carnage. Like the previous film, Venom: Let There Be Carnage faced
              mixed to negative reviews and opinions, but was deemed a box
              office success by making well over $500 million worldwide. Now,
              three after the release of Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Sony
              Pictures and director Kelly Marcel present the suppose final entry
              in this representation of Eddie Brock and his alien symbiote with
              the release of Venom: The Last Dance. Does this movie close out
              the narrative that began back in 2018 in a satisfactory way or is
              it just a haphazard and incoherent superhero outing that lacks
              both substance and finesse within this undertaking?Under his now
              “commonplace” unusual circumstance, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is
              current a fugitive, looking to hide out in Mexico with his
              symbiote partner-in-crime, Venom, after Detective Mulligan
              (Stephan Graham) is killed. When the d Carnage had their problems
              in the previous two Venom movies, Knull and his army of xenophages
              feel thinly sketched and flat as villains.

              n 2015, Pixar Animation Studios released their fifteenth animated
              feature film titled Inside Out, showcasing a “wave of emotions”
              within this now beloved cartoon motion picture. Directed by Pete
              Docter, the film, which starred the voice talents for Amy Poehler,
              Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, and Mindy Kaling, follows
              the inner workings of the mind of Riley, a young girl who adapts
              to her recent family’s relocation as five personified emotions
              manage her thoughts and actions during this transition period.
              Debuting in theaters on June 19th, 2015, Inside Out went onto
              reach critical acclaim during its theatrical run, with many
              praising the film for its craftmanship, screenplay, plot, subject
              matter, and all the vocal performances. In addition, the movie
              went on to gross over $858 million at the box office worldwide and
              finished as the seventh highest grossing film of 2015. In
              conjunction with that, Inside Out went on to receive numerous
              accolades during the various award season, including winning Best
              Animated Feature for both the 88th Academy Award and the 2015’s
              Golden Globes. Furthermore, many news journalist and film
              institute / organization praised Inside Out, citing it to be one
              of the best animated films ever made. Now, almost nine years since
              its original release, Pixar Animated Studios (in association with
              Walt Disney Studios) and director Kelsey Mann present the
              long-awaited follow-up sequel to the critical 2015 film with the
              release of Inside Out 2. Does this sequel find merit and heart
              within its colorful cartoon narrative or is it a subpar and
              emotionless film that can’t replicate the same type of charm and
              magic that the original movie was able to capture?Riley
              (Kensington Tallman) is growing up and is now a teenager, turning
              the age of 13 and putting pressure on her emotions to deal with
              her new puberty setting in. At the ready are Riley’s core
              emotions, including Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith),
              Anger (Lewis Black), Fear, (Tony Hale), and Disgust (Liza Lapria),
              with the gang working to protect the human’s Belief system, which
              makes up who she is. Disrupting Riley’s HQ is the arrival of new
              emotions that coincide with her new teenage angst, which includes
              Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adele
              Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser). Moving
              into Riley’s control room to express her new feelings, the
              hockey-loving teenager is now off to camp with her friends,
